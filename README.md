# Multi-Class Image-Classification using pre-trained Neural Networks

## Introduction

Food is an indispensable part of our daily lives, and the ability to categorize several food items in images has become a vital area of interest in machine vision and artificial intelligence. This research work is a well-thought-out initiative utilizing powerful deep learning model to predict 5 classes of images that belong to different kinds of food items.

This task uses two state-of-the-art models pre-trained on ImageNet namely MobilenetV2 and InceptiobnV3 to solve multi-class image classification problem. The aim of the project is to harness the power of AI in grocery shopping which aids in analyzing dietary contents of daily food consumption and improving customer experience using AI powered self-checkout systems.
